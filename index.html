    <p>Driving back to Arkansas from my parents' home in Indiana, I listened to one of my favorite podcasts, <a href="https://theliturgists.com/">the Liturgists</a>. This week, their episode was on #cancelculture, and unpacking what that means.</p>
    <p>While I'm not on social media very often, and while I don't see many redeeming qualities about social media to begin with, the phenomenon of cancel culture has been hard to ignore. There's something about it that makes me feel uneasy, but it was hard to articulate. Until I listed to the <a href="https://theliturgists.com/podcast/2020/9/24/4yq2huvn4ywya70ty03x6ns0kygrr9">cancel culture episode</a>.</p>
    <p>The hosts spoke with many different experts on topics that are related to cancel culture, like social media, psychology, beliefs, evolution, current events, history, neuroscience, and more. As usual, they start talking about one thing and end up talking about everything.</p>
    <p>I actually found that I learned a lot, especially from the conversation with <a href="https://peterrollins.com/">Peter Rollins</a>. If I haven't already made you feel weird, I'm telling you now –– it's about to get weird.</p>
    <p>Peter Rollins and Michael Gungor (one of the podcast hosts) are both really into this concept of non-duality (you can go down your own rabbit hole for that one), which essentially means that is no such thing as black-or-white truth or concrete axioms. Everything is really in the grey area. For the love of God don't confuse this with post-modernism; let me finish.</p>
    <p>With cancel culture, their basic idea was that when you see or learn about something or someone online that you hate, and you get on the #cancelsomething or #cancelsomeone bandwagon, you're not really trying to cancel that other thing. What's really happening is you're recognizing a part of yourself in the thing that you hate, and wanting to cancel that part of yourself.</p>
    <p>Basically, instead of believing yourself separate from &quotthe other&quot, you can believe that you're &quotentangled&quot with it, because really you're not an individual. You're born within a context of the universe, the Earth, your family, and you're connected to all of it and you survive as a result of your connection to those things. You learn to be an individual later.</p>

    <p>If you can see yourself as entangled with the thing you want to cancel, it will totally change the exchange you have. If you can see yourself in the other, you'll be more inclined to have a real conversation about it.</p>
